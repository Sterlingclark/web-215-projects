    On the line below this multi-line comment, create a SECTION with an ID of 'gallery'.
    Within that SECTION, create five child DIVs.
      Give the first an ID of 'thumbs'.
      Give the second an ID of 'full-size'.
      Give the third an ID of 'thumb-roundness-control'.
      Give the fourth an ID of 'large-roundness-control'.
      Give the fifth an ID of 'description-control'.

    Inside the #thumbs DIV, add the 4 image thumbnails.
    You'll find them in the img folder.
    You can also refer to the screenshot in the PDF.
    Link each thumbnail to the matching large version of the image.

    Inside the #full-size DIV, add the full size image of the demon.

    Inside the #thumb-roundness-control, add a child DIV with no ID. Inside that child DIV, add a LABEL with the text 'Thumbnail roundness:' and an INPUT tag with an ID of 'slider-thumb'. Make the input tag a range slider with minimum and default values of 0 and a maximum value of 50.

    Inside the #large-roundness-control, add a child DIV with no ID. Inside that child DIV, add a LABEL with the text 'Large image roundness:' and an INPUT tag with an ID of 'slider-large'. Make the input tag a range slider with minimum and default values of 0 and a maximum value of 50.

    I've created the DESCRIPTIONS section for you. You're welcome.
    But it's incomplete. You'll need to come back later to update it.

        <h2><cite>Japanese Good Luck Demon</cite><br>
          <i>created by Jun Maekawa</i></h2>
        <p>Amazing that this detailed good luck token was folded from a single uncut square. Fingers, horns, ears, wings, tail, face - all from a single sheet. It's said that keeping one of these little guys on your nightstand keeps away the evil spirits that cause bad dreams.</p>

        <h2><cite>Fluffy</cite><br>
          <i>created by Mark Kirschenbaum</i></h2>
        <p>This cuddly teddy bear was folded from a single uncut square from a paper bag. It's an example of <i>inside-out origami</i>. The paper is colored different on the front (brown) and back (black) to achieve contrasting details.</p>

        <h2><cite>Praying Mantis</cite><br>
          <i>created by Robert Lang</i></h2>
        <p>One uncut square of tissue foil, which is a sandwich made of standard origami foil (similar to tin foil but sturdier) in the middle and tissue paper on the outsides. The sandwich is glued together with spray glue to create a three-ply sheet of paper that holds its shape well.</p>

        <h2><cite>Salmon</cite><br>
          <i>created by Issei Yoshino</i></h2>
        <p>Folded from one uncut square of tissue foil and another example of inside-out origami. The diagrams for this model appear in the book <cite>Super Complex Origami</cite>, which includes other impressive models such as motorcycles, tiger, wild boar, various dinosaurs, and a wearable Samuri hat.</p>
