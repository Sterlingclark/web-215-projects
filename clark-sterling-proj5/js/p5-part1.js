/*

/*
Extract the year, month by number, date, and day of week by number and log them to the console
Be sure to log the correct month number. For example, January = 1, not 0
*/


/*
Append a leading 0 to the month number for January through September as those month numbers have a single digit. Log the new number to the console.
*/


/*
Convert the month number to a month name (long name, not an abbreviation) and log it to the console
*/


/*
Convert the day number to a day name (long name, not an abbreviation) and log it to the console
*/

Friday, April 10, 1970
*/


/*
Create a <b> element, populate its text with the string above, and place it on the page after the hardcoded <br> tag inside the hardcoded paragraph. If you are cringing because you think the <b> tag is deprecated, read the explanation in Part 2 of this project.
