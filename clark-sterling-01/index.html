          <p>I have a good amount of experience with HTML and CSS. After finishing WEB-115 and WEB-210 I have created a few different sites some have just been done on a local environment while others I have pushed to servers in the PHP specific classes. I finished WEB-115 with and A and WEB-210 with a B. I learned a great deal in each course, but I did find that I learned more in WEB-210. I am confident in my current coding skills but am always looking for learning opportunities and to make myself a better programmer. I believe that I have the ability to write semantic, valid, accessible, and developer-friendly code. How you can tell that HTML is written semantically is by looking at the tags that are used, some tags are more semantic than others. When writing code, it is important that you run your code through a validator to determine if it is valid HTML and CSS. One of the best ways to tell if your code is accessible is by using the WAVE Evaluation Tool which checks a sites accessibility and tells you what accessibility errors a site has. You can tell code is on the language.</p>
